# Face Recognition Project

This project uses deep learning and OpenCV to detect and recognize faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Face detection using Haar cascades or DNN
- Face recognition using pre-trained models
- Real-time camera input with bounding box visualization
- Option to store and label new faces

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Face Recognition (dlib or deep face libs)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
